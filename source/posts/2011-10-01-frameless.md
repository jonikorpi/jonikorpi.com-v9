**[Frameless](http://framelessgrid.com) is another static-width grid system** for adaptive web design. It's based on the same principles as [Less Framework](http://lessframework.com/) and is an attempt to develop the idea of an adaptive static-width grid further.

The concept: adapt column by column, not pixel by pixel. Create a column grid with an infinite number of columns, and activate and deactivate columns as needed, never changing the grid's column and gutter widths. The result is a grid that adapts only when there's enough space on the screen to do so, never compromising the ratios its dimensions are based on.
