**[Golden Grid System](http://goldengridsystem.com) is a completely fluid-width grid system** for responsive web design.

I published it during the time responsive design was really gaining steam, so it ended up getting quite a bit of publicity. Unfortunately I did a bad job in presenting it, making many people misunderstand how it should and should not be used.
